We got five minutes for us to disconnect

From all intellect and let the rhythm effect

Obstacles are inefficient, follow your intuition

Free your inner soul and break away from tradition

'Cause when we be out, girlies pull they weave out

You wouldn't believe how we wow shit out

Burn it 'til it's burned out, turn it 'til it's turned out

And runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin'

And runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin'...

What's wrong with the world, Mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin' in? People keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the truth, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love?
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity? (Yeah)
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? (Yeah)
Instead of spreading love, we spreading animosity (Yeah)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself

Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?

Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?

Now sing with me, y'all (One world, one world)
We only got (One world, one world)
That's all we got (One world, one world)
And something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with the w-world, world, yeah
We only got (One world, one world)
That's all we got (One world, one world)

Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

Hey baby, my nose is gettin' big
I noticed it be growin' when I be tellin' them fibs, now
You say your trust's gettin' weaker
Probably 'cause my lies just started gettin' deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learned my lesson
And I really think you ought to know the truth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after I did it, I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I've been a little immature
With your heart like I was the predator
In my book of lies, I was the editor
And the author, I forged my signature
And now I apologize for what I did to ya
'Cause what you did to me I did to you

No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie
'Cause you know, know, know, know
Yeah, you know, know, know, know, you gotta try
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I really see you, what you're all about?
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie
'Cause you know, you know, you know, you know
You know you gotta try (Stop, st-stop, stop, st-stop stop lying)

She said, "I'm leaving"
'Cause she can't take the pain
It's hard to continue this love, it ain't the same
Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain
Too many lies committed, too many games
She feelin' like a fool gettin' on the last train
Tryna maintain, but the feeling won't change
I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane
Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame
I don't know the reason why I did these things

Oh, and I lie and I lie and I lie and I lie

And now our emotions are drained

'Cause I lie and I lie and a little lie, lie
And now your emotions are drained

No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie (Don't, don't you lie)
'Cause you know, know, know, know
Yeah, you know, know, know, know, you gotta try (Got to, got to try)
What you gonna do when it all comes out (What you gonna do, baby?)
When I really see you, what you're all about?
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie
Because you know, you know, you know, you know
You know you gotta try

Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh

Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh (Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)

Hmm, yo, I'm lyin' to my girl
Even though I love her and she all in my world
I give her all my attention and diamonds and pearls
She the one that make me feel on top of the world
Still I'm lyin' to my girl, I do it

Oh, and I lie and I lie and I lie and then I lie
'Til there's not turning back
I don't know why I lie and I lie
'Til I don't know who I am
But then I tell myself

No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie (Don't you lie)
'Cause you know, know, know, know
Yeah, you know, know, know, know, you gotta try (You know, you know you gotta)
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I really see you, what you're all about?
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no
(Stop, st-stop, stop, st-stop stop lying)
